## üöÄ Database Setup and Data Insertion

First things first, let's get our database and tables created and populated with data.

```sql
-- USE Assignment_SQL_Queries; -- This line is not needed if you drop and create the database

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS Assignment_SQL_Queries;
CREATE DATABASE Assignment_SQL_Queries;
USE Assignment_SQL_Queries;

-- Create Tables
CREATE TABLE programmer(
    pname VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    dob DATE,
    doj DATE,
    gender VARCHAR(1),
    prof1 VARCHAR(20),
    prof2 VARCHAR(20),
    salary INT
);

CREATE TABLE software(
    pname VARCHAR(20),
    title VARCHAR(20),
    developin VARCHAR(20),
    scost DECIMAL(10, 2), -- Changed to DECIMAL for more accurate cost representation
    dcost DECIMAL(10, 2), -- Changed to DECIMAL for more accurate cost representation
    sold INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(pname) REFERENCES programmer(pname) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE studies(
    pname VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts: Your Data Analysis Toolkit

Before we dive into the queries, let's quickly get familiar with some essential database building blocks. Understanding these will help you grasp the logic behind each solution\!

  * **`SELECT`**: This is your go-to command to **pick which columns (or all columns using `*`) you want to see** from your tables.

      * **Scenario**: "Show me just the programmer names and their salaries."

  * **`FROM`**: After `SELECT`, you use `FROM` to **specify which table(s) you're pulling data from**.

      * **Scenario**: "I want to get this information *from* the `programmer` table."

  * **`WHERE`**: This clause is your **filter**\! It lets you specify conditions to **retrieve only the rows that meet certain criteria**.

      * **Scenario**: "Only show me programmers *where* their salary is greater than 3000."

  * **`AVG()` / `SUM()` / `COUNT()` / `MIN()` / `MAX()`**: These are **aggregate functions**. They perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single summary value.

      * **`AVG()`**: Calculates the **average** value.
          * **Scenario**: "What's the *average* selling cost of software?"
      * **`SUM()`**: Calculates the **total sum** of values.
          * **Scenario**: "What's the *total revenue* from all software sales?"
      * **`COUNT()`**: Counts the **number of rows** (or non-null values in a column).
          * **Scenario**: "How *many* programmers do we have?"
      * **`MIN()`**: Finds the **smallest** value.
          * **Scenario**: "What's the *lowest* development cost for any software?"
      * **`MAX()`**: Finds the **largest** value.
          * **Scenario**: "Who earns the *highest* salary?"

  * **`GROUP BY`**: When you use aggregate functions, `GROUP BY` lets you **group rows that have the same values in specified columns** so that the aggregate function works on each group individually.

      * **Scenario**: "Calculate the average salary *for each gender*." (You'd `GROUP BY gender`)

  * **`HAVING`**: Similar to `WHERE`, but `HAVING` is used to **filter groups** that were created with `GROUP BY`. You *cannot* use `WHERE` with aggregate functions directly.

      * **Scenario**: "Show me only those programming languages where the *average sales revenue is above a certain amount*."

  * **`ORDER BY`**: This clause is for **sorting** your results. You can sort in ascending (`ASC`, default) or descending (`DESC`) order.

      * **Scenario**: "List programmers by salary *from highest to lowest*."

  * **`JOIN` (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`)**: Joins are how you **combine rows from two or more tables** based on a related column between them.

      * **`INNER JOIN`**: Returns only the rows where there's a **match in *both* tables**. Think of it as the intersection.
          * **Scenario**: "Show me software details *and* the programmer's salary, but only for software that *has* a matching programmer."
      * **`LEFT JOIN`**: Returns **all rows from the *left* table**, and the matching rows from the right table. If there's no match on the right, you'll see `NULL` values for the right table's columns.
          * **Scenario**: "List all programmers, *and* if they've developed software, show those details. Even if they haven't developed anything, I still want to see their names."

  * **`UNION` / `UNION ALL`**: These combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set.

      * **`UNION`**: Removes duplicate rows.
      * **`UNION ALL`**: Includes duplicate rows.
          * **Scenario**: "Combine a list of primary proficiencies with secondary proficiencies into one single list of all skills."

  * **`DISTINCT`**: Used with `SELECT` to **return only unique values**, eliminating duplicates.

      * **Scenario**: "Show me all the *unique* programming languages used in software development."

  * **`TOP` (or `LIMIT` / `FETCH FIRST` depending on SQL dialect)**: Restricts the number of rows returned in a result set.

      * **Scenario**: "Show me the *top 3* highest-paid programmers."

  * **`WITH` (Common Table Expressions - CTEs)**: A way to define a **temporary, named result set** that you can reference within a single statement. They make complex queries much more readable and manageable.

      * **Scenario**: "First, figure out the average student count per course. *Then*, use that average in another part of my query to find courses below that average."

  * **`DATEDIFF()` / `YEAR()` / `MONTH()` / `GETDATE()`**: These are common **date/time functions**.

      * **`DATEDIFF(interval, startdate, enddate)`**: Calculates the difference between two dates based on a specified interval (e.g., year, month, day).
      * **`YEAR(date)` / `MONTH(date)`**: Extracts the year or month from a date.
      * **`GETDATE()`**: Returns the current date and time.
          * **Scenario**: "Calculate a programmer's age or experience based on their date of birth/joining and the current date."

  * **`CASE WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE ... END`**: This is a **conditional expression** that allows you to specify different outcomes based on various conditions.

      * **Scenario**: "If a programmer's birth month is after the current month, subtract one year from their age calculation."
