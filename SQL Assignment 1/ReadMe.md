# SQL Assignment: Deep Dive into Programmers & Software üìä

## Level Up Your Database Skills! ‚ú®

Hey there, data enthusiasts! üëã

Ever wanted to dive deep into a dataset and pull out valuable insights? SQL is your superpower! I've just completed a comprehensive SQL assignment, meticulously crafted from database creation all to answering complex analytical questions.

This project uses a relational database focused on programmers, their software developments, and their educational backgrounds. It's packed with scenarios you'd likely face in real-world data analysis, making it a great practical exercise!

**What's inside this repository?**

* **Database Setup & Data Population**: All the SQL to get the database up and running.
* **A Peek at the Actual Data**: See the raw data we're working with.
* **Core & Advanced Queries**: Challenging questions solved with detailed solutions, hidden in interactive dropdowns for a clean view!

Whether you're a seasoned #DataAnalyst, an aspiring #SQLDeveloper, or just curious about #DatabaseManagement, there's something here for you!

Let's get started by setting up our database, reviewing the data it holds, and then exploring some fundamental concepts! üëá

## üöÄ Database Setup and Data Insertion

First things first, let's get our database and tables created and populated with data.

```sql
-- USE Assignment_SQL_Queries; -- This line is not needed if you drop and create the database

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS Assignment_SQL_Queries;
CREATE DATABASE Assignment_SQL_Queries;
USE Assignment_SQL_Queries;

-- Create Tables
CREATE TABLE programmer(
    pname VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    dob DATE,
    doj DATE,
    gender VARCHAR(1),
    prof1 VARCHAR(20),
    prof2 VARCHAR(20),
    salary INT
);

CREATE TABLE software(
    pname VARCHAR(20),
    title VARCHAR(20),
    developin VARCHAR(20),
    scost DECIMAL(10, 2), -- Changed to DECIMAL for more accurate cost representation
    dcost DECIMAL(10, 2), -- Changed to DECIMAL for more accurate cost representation
    sold INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(pname) REFERENCES programmer(pname) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE studies(
    pname VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    institute VARCHAR(20),
    course VARCHAR(20),
    coursefee INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(pname) REFERENCES programmer(pname) ON DELETE CASCADE
